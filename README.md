# Microsoft Film Industry Analysis
## Overview
As a result of the rise in original film production in mega companies, Microsoft has tasked us with the responsibility to appraise her of the movie industry outlook before it climbs on the bandwagon. We used the return on investment as a measure to gauge the profitability of particular gernres, previewed the month of release of those perticular movies, looked into the genres that were most popular and those that had high viewer votes so we could come up with conclusions.

## 1. Business Problem

The potential business challenge for Microsoft in entering the original video content space lies in figuring out how to create content that stands out from competitors and attracts and retains viewers. With established players like Sony and Disney already producing exceptional original content, Microsoft will need to differentiate itself and create compelling content that resonates with audiences. To gain a foothold in the market, Microsoft should:
  
* Identify top five movies with the highest world wide gross
* Find the average total domestic gross per annum.
* Find the Production budget for the top five highest earning movies


## 2. Data Understanding
This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from two movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo and The Numbers.

The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.

The second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. The key variable for this dataset is the ROI, and the monetary data columns are the primary reason for selecting this dataset.


## 3. Methods

I gathered reliable data from trustworthy sources and eliminated irrelevant data columns. Additionally, I ensured that any information I used was from reputable sources and used both descriptive statistics and visual aids to identify patterns and important factors that contribute to successful movies. This methodology was suitable for examining trends in the film industry and identifying characteristics shared by high-earning movies, so I could provide well-informed suggestions.

## 4. Results

Based on the bar plot analysis,

From the above bar plot, we can see that the year in which the highest domestic gross income was generated was in 2016 where gross income from the movies was 11,253,653,097 dollars.

From our findings Avatar holds the lead in the Worldwide gross earnings.
Jurassic world has the least World wide gross earnings in the least of five.


Gross Earnings

 From the two Bar graphs above, we can see that production budget of a movie plays a huge role in the amount of earnings a Movie will make. For instance, the movie Avatar had a production budget of 425 million dollars and the gross worldwide earnings from the movie were 2.7 billion dollars. Though this might not be the only factor for these high earnings, it is quite essential that a proper budget is set for Movie production.



## Conclusion

Entering the original video content space presents significant opportunities and challenges for Microsoft. To succeed against giants like Sony and Disney, Microsoft must invest heavily in production quality, as seen with top-grossing films like Avatar and Avengers: Endgame. These films demonstrate that high production budgets correlate with substantial earnings. Microsoft should establish strategic partnerships with media companies to expand reach and leverage industry expertise. Significant investments in content development, talent acquisition, and marketing are crucial, along with collaborating with established content creators to tap into existing fanbases. Implementing robust feedback mechanisms will ensure continuous improvement in content quality based on viewer responses. By learning from successful blockbusters and prioritizing high production values, strategic partnerships, and effective marketing, Microsoft can differentiate itself and attract a loyal audience, positioning itself as a formidable player in the original content market.
